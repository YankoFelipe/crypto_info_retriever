### Add credentials

API_KEY = 
SECRET_KEY = 
SYMBOL = BTCUSDT
DB_USER = test
DB_PASS = test
DB_URI = localhost
DB_PORT = 5432
FLASK_RUN_PORT = 5500
```

### Run
To get trades use:
```bash
pipenv run flask trades --begin <INT> --end <INT>
```
Both parameters must be multiply of 1000. It is recommended tu use 35000000 as the begin ID considering that it maps to 2018.04.12 (the time t_0 of this project).

To generate prices from your trades use:
```bash
pipenv run flask prices
```
If you already have prices it will continue from where it was left.
